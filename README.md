# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. Two models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification, were trained and evaluated to determine the better performer.

## Scenario Overview
The dataset contains information about passengers including features like age, sex, ticket class, fare, etc. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Import Libraries:** Necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and sklearn were imported.
2. **Load Data:** The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Summary Statistics:** Summary statistics including data types, non-null counts, and descriptive statistics were examined.
4. **Data Cleaning:**
   - NaN values were identified and handled.
   - Irrelevant feature columns were dropped.
5. **Dealing with Categorical Data:** Categorical variables were converted into dummy variables.
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The distribution of the target variable and the correlation between features were visualized.
7. **Split Dataset:** The dataset was split into train, validation, and test sets.
8. **Normalize Dataset:** The dataset was normalized using StandardScaler.
9. **Model Training (Baseline):** Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification models were trained and evaluated.
10. **Model Evaluation:** The models were evaluated using classification reports to compare their performance.
11. **Analysis:** Based on the classification reports, the Logistic Regression model was identified as the better performer due to higher precision, recall, and accuracy.

## Why Logistic Regression was Chosen as the Better Model
- **Higher Precision and Recall:** Logistic Regression achieved higher precision and recall for both classes compared to Random Forest Classification.
- **Balanced Performance:** Logistic Regression showed a better balance between precision and recall, indicating effective identification of both positive and negative cases.

## Selected Metric for Evaluation
- **Classification Report:** This metric was chosen because it provides insights into a model's performance across multiple metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. It gives a comprehensive view of the model's performance.

## Future Enhancements
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tune hyperparameters for both models to further improve their performance.
